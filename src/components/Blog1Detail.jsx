            Why are LLMs so Popular?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            LLMs are powerful because they can understand and generate human-like text. 
            This means they can be used for all sorts of things, like answering questions, 
            writing stories, and even creating code. Because of their usefulness, more and 
            more people are becoming interested in learning about them.

              "Why are they called \"Large?\" The \"large\" in LLM refers to the massive amount of data they are trained on and the huge number of parameters (the values that the model learns during training) they contain1",
              "What can LLMs do? LLMs can perform various tasks, including text generation, summarization, classification, and question answering."

              "Self-Attention: A key feature of the transformer model is its self-attention mechanism. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, helping it to understand the context and meaning of the text"

              "Pre-training: Before an LLM can be used for specific tasks, it needs to be pre-trained on a large dataset of text4. This pre-training allows the LLM to learn the basics of language, such as grammar, vocabulary, and context",
